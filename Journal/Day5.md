### What's Zapier

Zapier is a tool that allows you to automate tasks between different online applications, with no coding required. It does this by making the applications "talk" to each other through API connections.

We created a little interactive walkthrough of Zapier's interface here to help you get familiar! 
What can you build in Zapier

Zapier is like a super-helper robot. It can do a lot of different things to make your life easier. For example, it can move information from one place to another, send emails for you, and even make posts on social media.

You know how sometimes you have to copy something from one place and paste it into another? Or maybe you have to type the same thing over and over again? Well, Zapier can do that for you automatically, which saves you a lot of time and effort.

If you want to see all the cool things Zapier can do, you can look at its "app directory. It's like a big toy store or a library full of ideas. But remember, these are just ideas - you can be creative and think of your own ways to use Zapier too!

### Concepts I need to know about Zapier

The main idea of Zapier is something called a "Zap". A Zap is like a digital helper that connects your apps and makes them work together. It starts a task in one app when something happens in another. Think of it like a digital conveyor belt in a factory, automatically moving things from one place (app) to the next.

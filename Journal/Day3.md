Below we'll dive into some basics of Airtable you need to know before you start building. If you prefer visuals, watch this video and this video (or feel free to read the below!)...

### What is Airtable?

Airtable is a cloud-based platform that combines the simplicity of a spreadsheet with the complexity of a robust database. It allows users to organize content, tasks, projects, and more in a visual way. With Airtable, you can create bases (essentially databases) that hold tables (similar to sheets in a spreadsheet) filled with data records.

### What is a base?

A base is a collection of related tables, designed to help you manage a specific project, team, or workflow. Think of it as a database that's unique to your particular need, be it planning an event, tracking inventory, or managing customer relationships.

### What is a table? What is a view?

Table: Within a base, a table holds a specific set of data, similar to a sheet in traditional spreadsheet applications. For example, if you have a base for event planning, one table might be for "Attendees," another for "Vendors," and another for "Budget."
View: A view is a specific way to visually represent the data within your table. It determines how the records in a table are displayed and organized. There are different types of views in Airtable, like Grid (similar to a spreadsheet), Calendar (showing records in a calendar format), Kanban (like Trello cards), Gallery (displaying records as cards with an image), and more. You can switch between different views to analyze and manage your data in various ways.

### What is a data record?

A data record in Airtable is akin to a row in traditional spreadsheets. Each record represents an individual item or entry in your table. For instance, in an "Attendees" table, each record might represent a single attendee, with their name, email address, RSVP status, and other relevant details.

### What is a field? What are field types?

Field: A field in Airtable corresponds to a column in traditional spreadsheets. It represents a specific type of data or attribute that you want to track for each record. In our "Attendees" example, the "Name," "Email Address," and "RSVP Status" could each be individual fields.
Field Types: Airtable offers a variety of field types that help you structure and validate the data you input. Some of the commonly used field types include:
Text: For basic text input.
Number: For numeric values.
Date: For dates, with optional time.
Checkbox: A simple checkbox.
Multiple select: For choosing one or more options from a list.
Attachment: For adding files, images, etc.
Link to another record: To link records between tables.
... and many more.

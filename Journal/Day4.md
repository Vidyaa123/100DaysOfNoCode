### Concepts I need to know about Tally

- Tally's core concept is the Form Block. A Form Block is a section of the form that can contain one or more questions or form fields. You can customize each block with different question types, conditional logic, design options, and more. They are like building blocks for your form, and each one allows you to customize the content and appearance of your form.
